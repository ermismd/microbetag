    version: v.0.0.1

silva_database:
    description: Silva version used to map the taxonomy retrived to a NCBI Taxonomy id. microbetag exploits the 7-level version that Qiime builds out of the Silva database. Therefore, as long as Silva does not release a 7-level version of its latest release, microbetag needs to wait the Qiime group to do so.
    version: 132

new_taxdump:
    description: To keep track of the NCBI Taxonomy Ids indicating species and strains, microbetag makes use of the NCBI Taxonomy oriented file called "new_taxdump".

gtdb_database:
    description: microbetag takes exploits GTDB (https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/) to secure a set of high quality genomes that cover all the different taxonomic branches known up to now. Only the representative for their taxonomic level and those with a completeness > 95% and contamination < 5% are considered on the microbetag framework.
